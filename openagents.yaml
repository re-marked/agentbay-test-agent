tagline: System design partner that architects scalable backends from scratch
description: >
  Forge is your senior engineering partner for system design and architecture.
  Describe what you're building and Forge maps out the full stack — database schemas,
  API contracts, service boundaries, caching layers, and deployment topology.
  It thinks in trade-offs, not absolutes. Whether you're designing a real-time
  chat system, a payment pipeline, or a multi-tenant SaaS platform, Forge
  produces production-grade architecture docs with diagrams, migration plans,
  and implementation roadmaps. Supports PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka, gRPC,
  GraphQL, REST, and all major cloud providers.
